#What is procedural generation?

Games are works of art, and often require hours of delicate and purposeful designing to craft their unique experiences. If you want to create expansive games, with many worlds and challenges for your players to attempt to overcome; this can require take 100s of hours of design alone. Sometimes the game you are creating can benefit from some random elements, in levels particularly. 

If your game relies on large amounts of loot and hordes of enemies, then some randomness in the level design can keep your game feeling fresh and keep players on their toes. Games like Diablo, thrive off of their variety of environments and dungeons for players to explore in the search of better loot. Diablo makes great use of procedural generation to create their dungeons, they are not pre-designed level layouts but instead are created each time the player reaches a new location. 

In this guide, I am going to walk you through the creation of a procedural generation system using Python and Pygame. I want to show you that it is not a lack of designing at all but instead you have to change what you are designing. The focus of this article will be the rules I am implementing to create my system. This is not a one technique field, and there are hundreds of variations on the ways procedural generation is implemented, I will do my best to signpost these as we go through. 

#Setup

I am using Pygame and Python to create this system, but I am going to keep the explanations as general as possible so that you can apply these principles to whichever development environments you enjoy working in. The point of this guide is to show you how you can implement procedural generation and some of the techniques and tactics involved. 

I am going to use procedural generation to create a tiled level, stored in arrays that can be drawn by any script. I have made this choice because it allows me to use my procedural generation in whatever script I am running, so I can keep it seperate from any game code I am writing and just use it to populate a Map array that my game uses. 

~~~python
# Importing modules
import secrets # Secrets is a crypto grade randomness library - in my opinion better than random for this.
import math # For the math
from collections import namedtuple # Named tuples will be used to store information about the rooms
from pygame import Rect # This will be used to check for collisions.

# Map variables
TILE_SIZE = 32 # Dimensions of the tiles - change if neccessary
TILE_ACROSS = 32 # Use the previous variables to set a tile width
TILE_DOWN = 24 # and tile height

# Pygame variables
# Setting the width and height of the pygame window
WIDTH = TILE_SIZE * TILE_ACROSS
HEIGHT = TILE_SIZE * TILE_DOWN

def create_map():
    Map = []
    Rooms = []

    for x in range(TILE_ACROSS):
        row = []
        for i in range(TILE_DOWN):
            row.append(0)
        Map.append(row)
    
    return Map


~~~ 

This is the start of my project, and it establishes our first set of rules. Using variables as much as possible to control the constants in our system makes it easy to change them later. The tiles I will be working with are 32x32 pixels, but if I change them and want 64x64 tiles I only need to change 1 variable and my whole map will adjust. The other variables, are dependent on the tile size, but the WIDTH and HEIGHT variables will dictate how big the map is in pixels. 

The map is a 2 dimensional array, which matches the TILE_ACROSS and TILE_DOWN dimensions. To start off with it will be populated with entirely 0s. When I draw my map, 0 will identify a dirt tile, which means my map currently looks like this...

This is pretty boring, so lets create some rooms to populate them. 

## Create a room 

To create rooms through code, we first need to designate some rules for rooms in my map. 

When you are creating things through procedural generation, you still need to design but you design sets of rules rather than the nitty gritty of the levels design. The idea is that your rules, if they are followed, should guide the randomness in a way that means the levels have the feel and look you are after. 

The initial rules for my rooms are: 
1. Choose a random width and height
3. Choose a random position

These are my starters, but they are not finished yet and there are some flaws that need to be addressed. 

You won't want a room to have a width or height of 0, or even 1 for that matter. A room 1 tile high or wide would be more of a corridor. I also don't want a room that is the same size as my world, or even half of it. This means I need to set maximum and minimum room sizes, which I can accomplish through variables and an equation for randomising the width and height. 

I should also put some restrictions on the positions my rooms can appear in. I want there to be a border of at least a tile around the edge of my map. 

The final rules for the creation of my rooms are. 
1. Choose a random width and height but..
    + it should not be larger than 7 
    + nor less than 2.
2. Choose a random position on the map
3. The rooms details should be stored so they can be used later on 

~~~python
MAX_ROOM_SIZE = 7
MIN_ROOM_SIZE = 3
ROOM_PADDING = 2

MAP_BORDER = 1

NUMBER_OF_ROOMS = 12

Room = namedtuple('Room', ['width', 'height', 'pos_x', 'pos_y'])

def generate_room():
    rm_width = MIN_ROOM_SIZE + secrets.randbelow(MAX_ROOM_SIZE - MIN_ROOM_SIZE + 1)
    rm_height = MIN_ROOM_SIZE + secrets.randbelow(MAX_ROOM_SIZE - MIN_ROOM_SIZE + 1)

    rm_pos_x = secrets.randbelow(TILE_ACROSS - rm_width)
    if rm_pos_x < MAP_BORDER:
        rm_pos_x = MAP_BORDER
    rm_pos_y = secrets.randbelow(TILE_DOWN - rm_height)
    if rm_pos_y < MAP_BORDER:
        rm_pos_y = MAP_BORDER

    return Room(rm_width, rm_height, rm_pos_x, rm_pos_y)

## Generate multiple rooms

To fully populate the rooms in my map, I will use another variable to decide how many there will be. I have been working with 10 or so rooms, but feel free to mess with these variables to suit your needs. The main challenge with this stage is making sure the rooms don't overlap!

**Stopping overlaps** 

Using a named tuple to store the information about the rooms I am generating will be essential for the work I will do later, but it is also useful to make sure the rooms don't overlap. 

To do this, I have created another function called `create_rooms()`. This function will run a loop and generate an array of rooms. It calls the generate_rooms function to create rooms and then check whether they overlap with other rooms already generated. If the room does overlap, it is rejected and a new one is created. 

~~~python
ROOM_PADDING = 2

NUMBER_OF_ROOMS = 12

def create_rooms():
    Rooms = []
    for i in range(NUMBER_OF_ROOMS):
        intersect = True
        while intersect: 
            intersect = False
            rm = generate_room()
            for other in Rooms:
                room = other[0]
                padded_pos_x = rm.pos_x - 1
                padded_pos_y = rm.pos_y - 1
                padded_width = rm.width + 3
                padded_height = rm.height + 3
                rm_1 = Rect((room.pos_x*32, room.pos_y*32),
                                 (room.width*32, room.height*32))
                rm_2 = Rect((padded_pos_x*32, padded_pos_y*32),
                                 (padded_width*32, padded_height*32))
                if rm_1.colliderect(rm_2):
                    intersect = True
        Rooms.append([rm, {"NORTH": None, "SOUTH": None, "EAST": None, "WEST": None}])
    return Rooms
~~~

I am using the Rect objects in pygame to test for collisions between rooms. I have set a ROOM_PADDING variable which makes sure there is at least 1 square either side of my rooms. I create 2 rectangles that represent the rooms and ask pygame to check if they collide. This is done recursively, checking all the rooms that have already been created. 

I have also updated the `create_map()` function to draw the rooms into the Map array when they have been generated and tested. 

~~~python
def create_map():
    Map = []
    for x in range(TILE_ACROSS):
        row = []
        for i in range(TILE_DOWN):
            row.append(0)
        Map.append(row)
    Rooms = create_rooms()
    for rm in Rooms:
        for i in range(rm[0].width):
            for j in range(rm[0].height):
                Map[rm[0].pos_x+i][rm[0].pos_y+j] = 1
~~~

With that, my map has been populated with rooms.
